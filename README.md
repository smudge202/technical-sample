# technical-sample
Create an app where for a given location it will provide the current weather conditions by aggregating information from multiple different weather providers and then display the results back to the user.
This challenge can be done in many different ways, the architectural and technology choices are yours, show off with what you can achieve, or try learning something new. However it is important that your code is written in such a way that further weather providers could be easily added.
It should only take a few hours to complete, and to help two fake weather providers have been provided in the project to save the time of having to learn a new API.
If you run out of time or feel like there is some code you would refactor given the opportunity, just add some comments to explain what you would have done.
